# Progetto HTML CSS

This project is mainly based on HTML and CSS created by me (Edoardo Vitagliano) for the final project of the Start2Impact HTML and CSS course.

## Introduction

Within this project there is a completed and finished portfolio website, ready to be customized and / or used for your purposes.

## Materials

All frameworks \ programs I used to create this project are:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) , for the writing part of the code.
- [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/it/products/photoshop) , for all the graphics and logos made by me.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [MBDBootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com/) as an HTML and CSS framework I have opted for.
- All trying to have a compact and responsive site with any type of device from which it is viewed.
